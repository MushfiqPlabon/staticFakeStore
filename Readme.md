# E-commerce Product Display (Phitron SDP Practice)

This project serves as a practical exercise for the second day of Phitron course's Software Development Professional (SDP) track, 2nd Week, Module 7.5. It's a simple, static web application designed to showcase products fetched from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

[**Live Demo**](https://mushfiqplabon.github.io/staticFakeStore/)

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the fundamental structure of the web page.
- **Bootstrap:** Utilized for responsive design and streamlined UI components, eliminating the need for custom CSS.
- **JavaScript:** Powers the dynamic fetching and display of products, as well as the shopping cart functionality.

## Features

- **Dynamic Product Display:** Fetches and presents a list of various products from the Fake Store API.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices, thanks to Bootstrap's grid system and components.
- **Basic Shopping Cart:** Users can add products to a simple in-browser cart. The cart dynamically updates the item count, individual item quantities, and the total price.
- **Product Details:** Displays comprehensive product information (category, description, rating) in a browser alert when the "Details" button is clicked.
