# E-commerce Product Display (Phitron SDP Practice)

This project serves as a practical exercise for the second day of Phitron course's Software Development Professional (SDP) track, 2nd Week, Module 7.5. It's a simple, static web application designed to showcase products fetched from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the fundamental structure of the web page.
* **Bootstrap:** Utilized for responsive design and streamlined UI components, eliminating the need for custom CSS.
* **JavaScript:** Powers the dynamic fetching and display of products, as well as the shopping cart functionality.

## Features

* **Dynamic Product Display:** Fetches and presents a list of various products from the Fake Store API.
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices, thanks to Bootstrap's grid system and components.
* **Basic Shopping Cart:** Allows users to add products to a simple in-browser cart.
* **Product Details:** Provides a quick overview of individual product details via a browser popup.
